The idea is to create a small private IOT Plattform which can run on RaspberryPi 4 (or probably any equivalent Debian PC), just because I had the urge to create, random gadgets (with arduino microcontrollers) and join all the interactible components into one central webapp that is available in my LAN (maybe in the future even publicly)

Currently I'm only working on this this as a little side project, mainly to learn new things about Blazor and ASP.Net development, as well as DevOps with local tools
