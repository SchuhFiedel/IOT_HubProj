# Idea

The idea is to create a small private IOT Plattform which can run on RaspberryPi 4 (or probably any equivalent Debian PC), just because I had the urge to create, random gadgets (with Arduino microcontrollers) and join all the interactible components into one central webapp that is available in my LAN (maybe in the future even publicly).

Currently I'm only working on this this as a little side project, mainly to learn new things about Blazor and ASP.Net development, as well as DevOps with local tools.

Arduino implementation specifics will probably not be subject of this repo, at least for the forseeable future. But there will be general information about the implementation of the interface between the devices and the API that communicates with them.
